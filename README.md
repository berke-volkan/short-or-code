# Code & gamble at same time? üêß Introducing Short or code
## [psst are you a sieger? then click here](https://hackclub.slack.com/docs/T0266FRGM/F09JUPH7ALA)

Short or code is a slack bot where you can gamble on whatever some1 will code or not.This project is a crypto market simulation using [Hackatime](https://hackatime.hackclub.com/) (fork of [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/api-key)) API.

## How this works?
- You get 100 H$ (Hack Dollars) when you join to gamble on others!
- Short or code automatically creates a virtual coin represents your coding activity (Based on [Hackatime](https://hackatime.hackclub.com/))
- Be the best gambler & show your skills to world!

## Hack Dollars (H$)? What is that?
Hack Dollars is a virtual currency that powers code or short :) You can use your Hack Dollars by gambling on others! And earn by coding more (Coming Soon‚Ñ¢)

## Cool but... how token ƒ± bought will go up or down? based on what?
#   $\left(\frac{\text{Seconds Coded in Last 24h}}{10,800} - 1\right) \times 100$
A) Token creator coded for 12000 seconds in last 24h. 12.000/10.800=1,11   1,11-1=0,11   0,11*10=11.Token goes %11 up

B) Token creator coded for 5000 seconds in last 24h. 5000/10.800=0,46   0,46-1= -0,54   -0,54100=-54.Token goes %54 Down
